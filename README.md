### Business Problem: A company is looking to achieve inorganic growth through acquisitions. They have asked us to develop an online tool to track and analyze potential target companies. 

### Challenge: Develop a prototype that will allow the client to perform the following activities: 

• View a list of targets 
• Edit an existing target 
• Create a new target 
• Delete a target 

### Assumptions: 

• Use a modern JavaScript framework (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Ember, etc.) 
• Data does not need to be persisted (use mock data) 
• Examples of data to be captured: 
o Status (e.g., researching, pending approval, approved, declined) 
o Company Info 
o Key Contacts 
o Financial Performance 

### Additional notes: Please feel free to be creative and take the functionality beyond the minimal requirements. 

### Built Using Create React App and Context API
- Data is being pulled from customer jsonplacehoder

### Issues
- Because json placeholder only let's user create one additional business if two or more are created react throws a "key duplicate warning"
- Dynamically created business cannot be editted
